- Unit tests added for A2S packet parsing with captured byte arrays.
- Unit tests added for core server state transition rules.
- GitHub Actions CI added for format, build, test, and package vulnerability checks.
- Docker-based smoke-test notes added for polling against a live server.
- API integration tests added for snapshot history and dashboard overview.
- Readiness health check validates database connectivity.
- `GET /metrics` exposes ASP.NET Core, runtime, and application polling metrics in Prometheus format.
- Deterministic polling integration tests added with fake A2S query responses and EF-backed repositories.
- Integration tests cover incident opening after repeated polling failures.
- Architecture overview and runtime flow diagrams added to `docs/architecture.md`.
- PostgreSQL-backed integration tests added with Testcontainers and EF Core migrations.

## Immediate Next Milestone

Add server editing API.

Definition of done:

- `PATCH /api/servers/{id}` updates editable server fields.
- Update validation is covered by unit or integration tests.
- Existing polling/status behavior keeps working after server edits.

## Next Tasks

1. Add `PATCH /api/servers/{id}`.

2. Add `POST /api/servers/{id}/enable` and `POST /api/servers/{id}/disable`.

## v1 API Scope

Servers:

- `POST /api/servers`
- `GET /api/servers`
- `GET /api/servers/{id}`
- `PATCH /api/servers/{id}`
- `POST /api/servers/{id}/enable`
- `POST /api/servers/{id}/disable`

Monitoring:

- `GET /api/servers/{id}/status`
- `GET /api/servers/{id}/snapshots?from=&to=`
- `GET /api/dashboard/overview`

Incidents:

- `GET /api/incidents/open`
- `GET /api/servers/{id}/incidents`
- `GET /api/incidents/{id}`

Later command scope:

- `POST /api/servers/{id}/commands/change-map`
- `POST /api/servers/{id}/commands/restart`
- `POST /api/servers/{id}/commands/say`
- `POST /api/servers/{id}/commands/raw`
- `GET /api/servers/{id}/commands`
- `GET /api/commands/{commandId}`

Health and metrics:

- `GET /health/live`
- `GET /health/ready`
- `GET /metrics`

## Initial Entities

`Server`:

- `Id`
- `Name`
- `Game`
- `Host`
- `QueryPort`
- `RconPort`
- `IsEnabled`
- `PollIntervalSeconds`
- `Notes`
- `CreatedAtUtc`

`ServerCurrentState`:

- `ServerId`
- `Status`
- `IsReachable`
- `LastCheckedAtUtc`
- `LastSuccessAtUtc`
- `LatencyMs`
- `CurrentMap`
- `Players`
- `MaxPlayers`
- `FailureReason`

`PollSnapshot`:

- `Id`
- `ServerId`
- `CheckedAtUtc`
- `IsReachable`
- `LatencyMs`
- `Map`
- `Players`
- `MaxPlayers`
- `Bots`
- `RawVersion`
- `FailureReason`

`AvailabilityIncident`:

- `Id`
- `ServerId`
- `Type`
- `OpenedAtUtc`
- `ClosedAtUtc`
- `StartReason`
- `EndReason`

## Testing Plan

Start focused:

- Unit tests for A2S packet parsing with captured byte arrays.
- Unit tests for state transition rules.
- Integration tests for `POST /api/servers` and `GET /api/servers/{id}/status`.
- Testcontainers for PostgreSQL.
- Fake query client for deterministic polling tests.
- Integration test for incident opening after repeated failures.

Later:

- Integration coverage for `PATCH /api/servers/{id}`.

## Portfolio Readiness Checklist

Before calling v1 done:

- One-command local startup.
- Clear README.
- Architecture diagram or concise text diagram.
- Working polling against at least one real server.
- Current state and snapshot history.
- Basic incident detection.
- Health checks.
- Metrics.
- A few meaningful tests.
- A short section explaining trade-offs.
